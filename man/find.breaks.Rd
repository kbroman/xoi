\title{Estimate crossover locations}
\usage{
find.breaks(cross, chr)
}
\arguments{
\item{cross}{An object of class \code{cross}. (This must be a backcross,
RIL, or intercross.) See \code{\link[qtl]{read.cross}} for details.}

\item{chr}{Optional set of chromosomes on which to look for crossovers.  If
missing, all chromosomes are considered.}
}
\value{
If only one chromosome is considered, this is a list with one
component for each individual.  If multiple chromosomes were considered,
this is a list with one element for each chromosome, each of which is a list
with one element for each individual, as above.

For backcrosses and RIL, the componenets for the individuals are
\code{numeric(0)} if there were no crossovers or a vector giving the
crossover locations.  The length of the chromosome (in cM) is saved as an
attribute.  (Note that the format is the same as the output of
\code{\link{simStahl}}.)

For an intercross, the components for the individuals are themselves lists
with all possible allocations of the crossovers to the two meiotic products;
each component of this list is itself a list with two components,
corresponding to the two meiotic products.
}
\description{
Estimate the locations of crossovers in a backcross.
}
\details{
This works only a backcross, RIL, or intercross.  We use the function
\code{\link[qtl]{locateXO}} in R/qtl.  Crossovers are estimated to be at the
midpoint of the interval between the nearest flanking typed markers.

data(bssbsb)

# crossover locations on chromosome 1
xoloc1 <- find.breaks(bssbsb, chr=1)

# crossover locations on all chromosomes
xoloc <- find.breaks(bssbsb)
