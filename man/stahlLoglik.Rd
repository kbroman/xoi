\title{Calculate log likelihood for Stahl model}
\usage{
stahlLoglik(
  xoloc,
  chrlen = NULL,
  nu,
  p,
  max.conv = 25,
  integr.tol = 0.00000001,
  max.subd = 1000,
  min.subd = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{xoloc}{A list of crossover locations (in cM), each component being a
vector of locations for a different meiotic product.}

\item{chrlen}{Chromosome length (in cM), either of length 1 or the same
length as \code{xoloc}.}

\item{nu}{A vector of interference parameters (\eqn{\nu}{nu}) at which to
calculate the log likelihood.}

\item{p}{A vector of parameter values for the proportion of crossovers from
the no interference pathway.}

\item{max.conv}{Maximum limit for summation in the convolutions to get
inter-crossover distance distribution from the inter-chiasma distance
distributions.  This should be greater than the maximum number of chiasmata
on the 4-strand bundle.}

\item{integr.tol}{Tolerance for convergence of numerical integration.}

\item{max.subd}{Maximum number of subdivisions in numerical integration.}

\item{min.subd}{Minimum number of subdivisions in numerical integration.}
}
\value{
A vector of log likelihoods.

The corresponding values of nu and p are saved as attributes.
}
\description{
Calculate the log likelihood for the Stahl model for varying parameters,
with data on crossover locations.
}
\details{
See Housworth and Stahl (2003) and Broman and Weber (2000) for details of
the method.

If neither \code{nu} nor \code{p} has length 1, they both must have the same
length.  If one has length 1 and the other does not, the one with length 1
is repeated so that they both have the same length.

\examples{

data(bssbsb)
xoloc <- find.breaks(bssbsb, chr=1)

loglik <- stahlLoglik(xoloc, nu=4, p=c(0.05, 0.1, 0.15))
